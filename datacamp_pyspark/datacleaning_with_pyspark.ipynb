                "- Data cleaning is a necessary part of any production data system. If your data isn't \"clean\", it's not trustworthy and could cause problems later on.\r\n",
                "- There are many tasks that could fall under the data cleaning umbrella. A few of these include reformatting or replacing text; performing calculations based on the data; and removing garbage or incomplete data.\r\n",
                "- Most data cleaning systems have two big problems: optimizing performance and organizing the flow of data.\r\n",
                "-  Spark lets you scale your data processing capacity as your requirements evolve. Beyond the performance issues, dealing with large quantities of data requires a process, or pipeline of steps. Spark allows management of many complex tasks within a single framework.\r\n",

                "-  You may have used schemas before with databases or XML; Spark is similar. A schema defines and validates the number and types of columns for a given DataFrame. A schema can contain many different types of fields - integers, floats, dates, strings, and even arrays or mapping structures.\r\n",

The best way to gauge performance with caching is to test various configurations. Try caching your DataFrames at various points in the processing cycle and check if it improves your processing time.\r\n",

The last two arguments are the name of the file to be split and the prefix to be used. Assuming 'largefile' has 10M records, we would have files named chunk-0000 through chunk-9999. \n",

We've done this in previous examples and it works well for later analysis even if the initial import is slow.

This may be as simple as using the various Spark calculations to verify the number of columns in an irregular data set. The validation can also be applied against an external source: web service, local files, API calls. These rules are often implemented as a UDF to encapsulate the logic to one place and easily run against the content of a DataFrame. "
